<h2>The Premise</h2>
<h2>Background Info</h2>
<p>One of the first game projects that I made when I tried to learn Godot 4 was yet another top down shooter, dubbed <em>Project Source Decay</em>. Now, I&rsquo;m the type of person to not really like working on something if it&rsquo;s similar to something I&rsquo;ve already done without anything new; I like to create and explore new things rather than rehash something already made, so for this project I wanted to try implementing multiplayer.</p>
<p>(Talk about what inspired this. Scape and Run mod, Left 4 Dead 2, Cortex Command mod, etc.)</p>
<h3>First Iteration</h3>
<p>(Survivors on a dilapidated cruise ship)</p>
<h3>Second Iteration</h3>
<p>(Workers for a global organization dedicated to stopping the spread of the infection.)</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>(Talk about what the gameplay would&rsquo;ve been like.)</p>
<h2>Progress Made</h2>
<p>(Talk about the weapon system, enemy pathfinding and optimizations made, etc.)</p>
<h2>Decline</h2>
<p>(What was the reason that stopped you from making this? Talk about the difficulty in trying to design a game with multiplayer in mind, the lack of cohesive identity.)</p>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Ultimately, I still do enjoy the premise of what I had for this.</p>
<p>(Maybe talk about how the game could be more interesting if the infection had more emergent behaviors, like groups of enemies coalescing into one single mass to evolve, just like in the Scape and Run mod. Perhaps this game could&rsquo;ve been good as a more slower paced game rather than the frantic nature of L4D2 or Helldivers. Who knows.)</p>
